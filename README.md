Description: Our web application allows the user to search for and select a city that they would like to travel to, and then be provided with a series of events to attend and a weather forecast for that city.

Motivation: Our goal is to help our users successfully plan a trip, without having to be concerned about what they will do when they arrive or if the weather may not be nice.
